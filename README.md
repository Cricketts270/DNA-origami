# DNA-origami
# Code and .csv file to run with it

The csv file contains data from an ORBIT experiment on a RecBCD enzyme.  Described here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1397-7

An "X" shaped DNA origami rotor is attached to a strand of DNA that is fed though the enzyme RecBCD. 
The tip of one of the rotor arms is tracked, its movements in time are recorded in the csv file.
The x- and y- values in the csv file describe the location of the tip of one of the rotor blades as it moves with the DNA. 
Each row is a time step with difference between rows = 20 ms.
